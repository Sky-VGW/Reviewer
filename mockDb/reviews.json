This is odd because you can still “join” the bill again through the link after making an account, but can not go back to continue editing it.\n\nOverall this is an app that saves a lot of\ntime when it works well but wastes time when it does not.",

Then, the app added a 58 dollar tip and I have no idea where they came from even after investigating my receipt. A 20% tip on our bill (which we left) was only ~20 dollars. \n\nThis app also does not let you edit the dollar amount of tax charged (in my case the app put it down as 0, which isn’t correct), which seems like a massive oversight. You should at least have the option to manually enter the amount of percentage of tax charged considering how bad the app is at itemizing. \n\nI am giving two stars, simply because the app DID itemize the actual items on my receipt correctly, with correct dollar amount and (close enough) names. With some manual override, I was about to get the bill within ~10 dollars of the actual amount paid - so in the end it can still be useful. This app has a lot of potential, it just needs a better algorithm at itemizing, and a manual override feature for the amount of tax paid.",
